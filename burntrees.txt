DESCRIPTION
    Script for manipulating tree (*.t, *.trprobs, *.con, *.trees) and
    parameter (*.p, *.log) files from MrBayes (v.3), BEAST, and PhyloBayes.

    The script extracts trees and (by default) the taxon translation table
    and the trailing "end;" from tree file.

    A number of options are available:

    Any contiguous interval of trees can be printed, as well as trees only
    (nothing other than tree descriptions).

    The samples can be thinned by setting a value for how many trees to jump
    before next is printed.

    Branch lengths, support values, and comments can be removed from trees
    before printing.

    Branch lengths in scientific numeric format can be transformed to a
    fixed numeric format.

    MrBayes clock trees with branch lengths in substitutions per site can be
    transformed to branch lengths in time units.

    A random set of trees can be printed from the tree file.

    Lines can also be extracted from a MrBayes *.p file.

    Trees can be printed in Phylip (Newick) format or as altnexus (sequence
    labels instead of numbers), that is, the script can serve as an
    efficient tree format converter.

OPTIONS
    Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too

    -b, --burnin=*number*
            Start printing after tree *number*.

    -c, --close
            Forces a trailing "end;" to be printed after the last tree.
            --noclose prevents the "end;" to be printed. Note that the
            trailing "end;" in the tree file is printed by default unless
            --noclose is given.

    -co, --concatenate
            Concatenate several files -- *Not yet implemented*. See USAGE
            for alternatives.

    -e, --end=*number*
            End the printing of trees after tree *number* (inclusively). If
            no --end is given, prints to last tree in file.

    -f, --format=*format*
            Trees are printed as specified by *format*, where *format* is
            either *altnexus*: with sequence (taxon) labels instead of
            numbers, or *phylip* (the Newick format).

    -g, --getinfo
            Print information about the number of trees (or samples in p
            file), thinning, number of samples, presence of branch lengths
            and support values in file and quit.

    -h, --help
            Prints help message and exits.

    -i, --IFeelLucky=*number*
            Specify a probability (value between 0 -- 1) for each tree to be
            printed. That is, print each tree with prob. *number*. Note that
            --IFeelLucky has precedence over --jump.

    -j, --jump=*number*
            Specify a thinning. That is, print every *number* tree.

    -l, --labels
            Print trees using sequence (taxon) labels instead of the
            sequence numbers from the translation table. --nolabels (which
            is the default) prevents the sequence numbers to be substituted.

    -ma, --man
            Displays the manual page.

    -my, --myr
            Transform branch lengths in a MrBayes clock tree from
            substitutions per site to time units.

    -o, --outfile=*file_name*
            Print directly to file *file_name* instead of standard out.

    -p, --pburnin=*number*
            Start printing after a fraction of the run, where *number* is a
            percentage (e.g. "50" for half the run).

    -rmb, --rmbrlens
            Remove branch lengths from trees.

    -rmc, --rmcomments
            Remove comments (text within, and the enclosing square brackets)
            from trees.

    -rms, --rmsupport
            Remove support values (bootstrap/posterior probabilities) from
            trees.

    -sc, --sci2norm=*number*
            Translate branch lengths from scientific to normal or fixed.
            Change the precision by specifying the (optimal) *number*.

    -st, --start=*number*
            Start printing from tree *number* (inclusively).

    -t, --treesonly
            Print trees only (do not print taxon descriptions etc.). If used
            on a *.p file it skips the "ID" line and the headers.

    -v, --version
            Prints version message and exits.

    FILE    Reads a Nexus formatted tree FILE, preferrably MrBayes (v.3)
            *.t, *.con, and *.trprobs files. FILE can also be a MrBayes
            parameter file (*.p), or any Nexus formatted tree file, e.g.,
            output from BEAST or other phylogenetic MCMC software (not
            thoroughly tested!).

    OUTPUT  Prints to STDOUT unless --outfile= is used.

USAGE
    Examples:

      burntrees.pl --burnin=10 data.t > out.t
      burntrees.pl --pburnin=50 data.t
      burntrees.pl --start=11 --end=30 data.t
      burntrees.pl --jump=10 data.t
      burntrees.pl --treesonly data.t
      burntrees.pl --getinfo -b=10 data.t
      burntrees.pl --rmbrlens data.t
      burntrees.pl --rmcomments data.t
      burntrees.pl --ifeellucky=0.50 data.t
      burntrees.pl -b=10 -j=10 -t -rmb data.t
      burntrees.pl --treesonly -b=10 data.p
      burntrees.pl --format=altnexus data.t
      burntrees.pl -f=phylip --outfile=data.phy data.t
      burntrees.pl -f=p -b=1 data.con.tre

    For concatenation of several files, use (note the append redirection,
    ">>". See also separate script catmb.pl):

      burntrees.pl -b=10 -noc  data.run1.t >  data.t
      burntrees.pl -b=40 -t    data.run2.t >> data.t
      burntrees.pl -b=20 -t -c data.run3.t >> data.t

    To print the '#NEXUS', 'begin trees;', and the translation table only
    (no trees), or to print the header in .p, .trace, or .log files, use

      burntrees.pl -i -noc data.t

    To convert a MrBayes file to a 'altnexus' file or a 'phylip' file, use

      burntrees.pl --format=altnexus data.t
      burntrees.pl --format=phylip data.t

    To concatenate several files in to one altnexus formatted file, use
    (note the combination of '--format' and '--labels')

      burntrees.pl -b=10 -noc  -f=a data.run1.t >  data.t
      burntrees.pl -b=40 -t    -l   data.run2.t >> data.t
      burntrees.pl -b=20 -t -c -l   data.run3.t >> data.t

    To extract the 10th tree in phylip format, use

      burntrees.pl --start=10 --end=10 --format=phylip data.t

    To extract the second tree in the MrBayes .con.tre file (simple format)
    in phylip format, use

      burntrees.pl -b=1 -f=p data.con.tre

    To remove comments from tree descriptions (e.g. trees in "figtree"
    format), use

      burntrees.pl --rmcomments data.con.tre

    To remove support values from tree description for the first tree in a
    MrBayes .con.tre file (simple format) while changng branch lengths from
    scientific to normal (three decimals), use

      burntrees.pl --start=1 --end=1 --rmsupport --sci2norm=3 data.con.tre

    To remove branch lengths from tree descriptions, use

      burntrees.pl --rmbrlens data.t

    To change the branch length format from scientific to numerical (three
    decimals) use

      burntrees.pl --sci2norm=3 data.con.tre

    To change the MrBayes clock branch length format from substitutions per
    site to time units (Myr) use

      burntrees.pl --myr clock.t
      burntrees.pl --myr --rmcomments clock.t

    To (randomly) sample a specific number of trees, use burntrees.pl
    together with 'shuf'. Note that you could sample more trees than you
    have in your tree file (i.e., performing a bootstrap)!

      burntrees.pl -t data.t | shuf -rn 10
      burntrees.pl -t -f p data.t | shuf -rn 1000
