VERSION
    Documentation for catmb.pl version 0.1.1

SYNOPSIS
    catmb.pl [--burnin=<number>] [--pburnin=<number>] [--jump=<number>] FILE
    FILE [...] [> OUTPUT]

DESCRIPTION
    Script for manipulating tree (*.t) and parameter (*.p) files from
    MrBayes (v.3). This script is a helper for concatenating several files
    in to one (using the same burnin) using the script 'burntrees.pl'.
    burntrees.pl needs to be installed for catmb.pl to work.

OPTIONS
    Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too

    -b, --burnin=*number*
            Start printing after tree *number*.

    -p, --pburnin=*number*
            Start printing after a fraction of the run, where *number* is a
            percentage (e.g. "50" for half the run).

    -j, --jump=*number*
            Specify a thinning. That is, print every *number* tree.

    FILE    Reads Nexus formatted tree FILEs, preferrably a MrBayes (v.3)
            *.t file. Can also read and print a MrBayes parameter file (*.p
            file).

    OUTPUT  Prints to STDOUT.

    -h, --help
            Prints help message and exits

    -v, --version
            Prints version message and exits

    -m, --man
            Displays the manual page
